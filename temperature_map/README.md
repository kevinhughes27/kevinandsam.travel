## Temperate Map

A map of average temperature by time of year. A slider lets the user adjust the month and view the average temperature map.

Data is fetched from the World Bank climat api and saved to JSON using a python script. Note that this data is fairly complex - I had to choose a future scenario and modelling technique.
