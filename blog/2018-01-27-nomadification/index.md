For the past month we've been hard at work preparing to become Nomads. The process has included selling all our furniture, moving everything else to a storage locker and packing our backpacks (we'll write a more in depth post about what exactly we're taking with us).

We've also called almost every company we deal with to change our address or service in some way, visited city hall and the travel doctor a number of times. Needless to say we've been pretty busy and are very excited to finally get on our way!

When we've travelled in the past the last thing we do before leaving is lock up our apartment and pack the key away. It's a weird feeling to be leaving this time and not have a single thing tying us to home. This is our home now. We are Nomads.
