We've been travelling through the Balkans for the last month and Bosnia was definitely our favourite place. It's got more history, better food and just as many waterfalls but the main reason is that it's way less busy (looking at you Croatia...). The fact that it's way cheaper doesn't hurt either. Thanks to having visitors we picked up our travel pace and happened to create an excellent 6 day itinerary for Bosnia that we think is worth sharing.

We started in Sarajevo for 3 nights and 2 full days. On the first day we did a free walking tour to learn about the city and pick up a few other suggestions. It's always a good idea to do a walking tour early on and get familiar with a new place. We ate Cevapi in the old town, drank beers at a local brewery in a spectacular old building and picked up some Baklava for later.

Sarajevo has a lot of recent history - recent enough that our tour guide was alive during the [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars). Hearing about the war from someone our generation who experienced it was really special.

We enjoyed our first tour so much that on our second day in Sarajevo we did a more in depth war tour with the same guide and [company](http://www.bhspirit.com/). The first stop on the tour was the Tunnel of Hope built during the siege to supply the city. After the museum we drove up the hillside for a view of the city and then to visit the abandoned bobsled track from the 1984 Winter Olympics.

From Sarajevo we rented a car and drove north to Travnik and Jajce (pronounced more like Yahtzee). Our decision to rent a car was mostly for economic reasons with 4 travellers but the driving turned out to be incredibly scenic and worthwhile. In Travnik we walked around the old fortress and had lunch in a cafe by the river and waterfalls. This would set a new standard for lunch views that would only escalate the rest of our time in Bosnia.

We stayed overnight in Jajce and did most of our sightseeing the next morning. We visited the catacombs and the waterfall right in the middle of the town. Following a Lonely Planet recommendation we went to Pliva Lakes and had our most scenic lunch of the trip at Konoba Slapovi.

From Jajce we drove all the way down to Mostar where we stayed for 2 nights. We didn't do too much in the town itself aside from eat, wander the old town and look at the bridge.

For our full day we drove to nearby town of Blagaj famous for the Buna Spring and then onto the Kravice Waterfalls before returning to Mostar.

After 2 days in Mostar we drove back to Sarajevo which was an incredibly beautiful drive. Along the way we stopped in Konjic for lunch and a quick leg stretch. Konjic was a cute town with another classic bridge.

Our time in Bosnia was brief but dense and rich. Car travel is a bit of a new thing for us but it worked really well for Bosnia. I definitely levelled up my European driving skills on the old roads in Mostar (e-brake shifting is key).
