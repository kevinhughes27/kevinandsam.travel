  Validation, bad luck, redemption and reflections

Its been a month since we left our apartment and our transition to nomad life has been pretty smooth. Our planning paid off and we've done a good job actually doing life things that we might not normally do while travelling. Since leaving Canada we've visited a two local climbing gyms, played some pick-up Ultimate and completed 3 hotel work-outs. We've also already had the chance to use almost everything we packed which definitely builds confidence that we brought the right stuff. However we need to up our cooking game since we haven't cooked much in Guatemala and we're still adjusting to nomad pace versus traveller pace.

After our first weekend we immediately started a week long intensive Spanish school. I won't say we enjoyed it but it has already helped out a few times and we're both glad we did it. Hopefully, our Spanish will continue to improve as we travel around South America for the next few months.

After Antigua we headed to Xela. It was supposed to be a quick stop before staring a 3 day trek from Xela to Lago Atitlan. Unfortunately, Sam got the flu and we had to cancel our trek. Sam will say she hasn't been that sick in years which might be true but I was never worried (only bored). We were prepared to get sick at one point but we didn't expect it so soon and the timing was unfortunate.

Back on our feet again in Panajachel - we hiked up the Indian Nose for sunrise (same view our original trek was supposed to end with).

Our last stop in Guatemala was Flores to see the Mayan ruins of Tikal. Flores was our favourite spot in Guatemala. The town was a bit touristy but it wasn't too busy (currently) so was pretty chill. We stayed at [Casa de Grethel](https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Hostal-Casa-de-Grethel/Flores/274028) on an island across from Flores so we took a boat to and from - luckily the hostel has a free boat shuttle.

I've been reflecting on the differences between nomad life and vacations especially with our unplanned extension in Xela. Vacations are short and I think we feel a lot of pressure to have a great time - it's almost required for our personal narrative. How often does a coworker or friend return from a vacation and have anything but amazing things to say? We're going to be on the road for a long time and not everything is going to be perfect. We need to mentally adjust and allow ourselves to have bad days and not love everything and every place because this is our life for now and not a vacation.

Next up Colombia!
