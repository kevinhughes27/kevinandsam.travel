Buying sunscreen in China may seem like a simple thing but it was definitely a challenge in the more rural and less travelled regions. We were starting to run low on our supply which for most people is ok but for me, as a ginger in a sunny hot climate, it's a stressful situation.

We searched everywhere we could think of including grocery stores, pharmacies and even convenience stores with no luck. Finally we decided to try a cosmetics store and that’s where we found it. The sunscreen was sitting right beside the eyeshadow in the store.

When buying sunscreen in China you have to be careful which brand you pick – some contain bleach or whitening ingredients so stay away from those. Your best bet is to purchase a brand you recognize from home, which will be a bit more costly but you’ll know exactly what you’re getting.
