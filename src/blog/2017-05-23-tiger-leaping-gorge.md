upper gorge, also called ____, further than 4km, probably 10. Do it if you have time but consider skipping if you're doing the hike in 2 days or less

Timeline
--------
* started 11:30 at bus drop off
* trailhead at 12:15

* 1 hour lunch break
* teahorse guest house at 6:15 (this is the real halfway point, not halfway house)

Walnut gorge and sunset trail would be need another day in our opinion
