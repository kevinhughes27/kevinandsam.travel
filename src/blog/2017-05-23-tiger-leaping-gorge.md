upper gorge, also called ____, further than 4km, probably 10. Do it if you have time but consider skipping if you're doing the hike in 2 days or less

Timeline
--------
* started 11:30 at bus drop off
* trailhead at 12:15
* naxi guest house at 2:15

Walnut gorge and sunset trail would be need another day in our opinion
